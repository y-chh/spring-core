### Code flow:
Let's go through the code flow of the Spring Boot application that demonstrates changing runtime dependencies using constructor injection.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code flows when you run the application:

1. **Application Initialization**:
    - When you run the Spring Boot application (`PaymentApplication`), the `main` method is the entry point.
    - The `main` method starts the Spring Boot application context, which initializes Spring and its components.

2. **Spring Configuration**:
    - Spring scans the classpath for components, including those annotated with `@Service`. In this case, it finds two services: `CreditCardGateway` and `PayPalGateway`.
    - The `PaymentService` class is also discovered and marked as a service because it's annotated with `@Service`.

3. **`PaymentService` Dependency Injection**:
    - The `PaymentService` class is instantiated by Spring. During its instantiation, Spring detects that it has a constructor with a parameter of type `PaymentGateway`.
    - Spring looks for a suitable `PaymentGateway` bean to inject. At this point, it finds two candidates: `CreditCardGateway` and `PayPalGateway`.
    - The `paymentGateway()` method in the `PaymentConfig` class determines which implementation to provide. By default, it returns a `CreditCardGateway` bean.
    - Spring injects the chosen `PaymentGateway` implementation (in this case, `CreditCardGateway`) into the `PaymentService` constructor.

4. **`PaymentService` Execution**:
    - After initialization, the `PaymentApplication` class calls the `run` method. In this method, an `Order` instance is created for demonstration purposes.
    - The `PaymentService` instance (`paymentService`) created by Spring is used to process the payment. It invokes the `processPayment` method on the injected `PaymentGateway` implementation (`CreditCardGateway` in this case).

5. **Payment Processing**:
    - The `processPayment` method of the chosen `PaymentGateway` (e.g., `CreditCardGateway`) is called, simulating the processing of a payment. In this example, it prints a message indicating the type of payment being processed.

6. **Runtime Switching of Dependencies**:
    - You can change the behavior of the application at runtime by modifying the `paymentGateway()` method in the `PaymentConfig` class.
    - If you change it to return `new PayPalGateway();`, the Spring context will refresh (since it's annotated with `@Configuration`), and the `PaymentService` will be reinjected with the `PayPalGateway` implementation.
    - As a result, the payment processing logic will switch from credit card to PayPal without modifying the `PaymentService` class.

7. **Console Output**:
    - Depending on the chosen `PaymentGateway` implementation in the configuration, you will see different messages printed to the console indicating the payment processing method (e.g., "Processing credit card payment" or "Processing PayPal payment").

In summary, the code flow demonstrates how Spring Boot manages the instantiation and dependency injection of beans. By changing the configuration, you can dynamically switch between different implementations of the `PaymentGateway` interface at runtime, without altering the code of the `PaymentService`. This approach provides flexibility and modularity in designing and configuring your application.
