Questions:
1. Why using sub-interface is a better design approach?
   Extending the `DataSource` interface to create `RemoteDataSource` and `LocalDataSource` sub-interfaces, as opposed to directly implementing the `DataSource` interface in `RemoteDataRepository` and `LocalDataRepository`, is a design choice that provides several benefits:

1.1 **Clarity and Separation of Concerns:**

   By introducing sub-interfaces, you explicitly define the contract for remote and local data sources separately. This makes it clear that a `RemoteDataSource` is a specific type of `DataSource`, and a `LocalDataSource` is another specific type. This separation of concerns helps in maintaining a clear and organized codebase.

1.2 **Semantic Clarity:**

   Sub-interfaces can have names that reflect their specific purpose. For example, `RemoteDataSource` and `LocalDataSource` names convey the intended usage of these interfaces. This semantic clarity makes the code more self-explanatory and helps developers understand the role of each interface without needing to examine their implementations.

1.3 **Future Extensibility:**

   Sub-interfaces allow for future extensibility. If you decide to add more specialized types of data sources in the future, you can create additional sub-interfaces that extend `DataSource`. This approach maintains a structured hierarchy of data source types.

1.4 **Ease of Configuration and Dependency Injection:**

   When you use sub-interfaces, it's easier to configure and inject specific implementations based on their types. For example, you can use `@Qualifier` with `@Autowired` to specify which implementation to inject based on the interface type. With a flat structure, it can be more challenging to disambiguate implementations.

1.5 **Maintainability and Code Organization:**

   Sub-interfaces promote maintainability and code organization. As your application grows, having a clear hierarchy of interfaces can make it easier to manage and extend the codebase. It also aids in documenting the intended use and responsibilities of each interface.

In summary, while you can directly implement the `DataSource` interface in `RemoteDataRepository` and `LocalDataRepository`, using sub-interfaces provides a more structured and semantically clear approach. It enhances code readability, maintainability, and future extensibility while also making it easier to configure and inject specific implementations based on their roles.

2. Application flow?
>When you run this Spring Boot application, here's what happens:
The application starts, and the Spring context is initialized.
Initially, neither the RemoteDataRepository nor the LocalDataRepository beans are created because they are marked as @Lazy.
When the run method is called, the DataService is used to fetch remote and local data.
At this point, Spring initializes the required data source bean (either RemoteDataRepository or LocalDataRepository) lazily based on which method is invoked.
Finally, the data is fetched and printed to the console.
